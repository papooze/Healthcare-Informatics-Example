This Python program is from my first project I undertook from my Healthcare informatics work.

I hadn't used much version control from GIT, and as such it became a large mess of a program. 

It has a LOT of problems to be sure, but I had to get a bit creative to 
produce visuals as well as the relevant stats.

I ended up using Seaborn for the visuals, so this particular project lacked the use of matplotlib.

I think the hardest part of this for me was getting the data to tell an actual story, I was focused on 
trying to visualize all of independent and dependent variables that I had a hard time looking at how they
all intertwined together.
